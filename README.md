Playground for the game json file content before deploying to shaheen codebase

Open a pull request if you have something that isn't here, you can... it's just json :)

## For contributing
Your file should start with date then the file you are adding to with .json ending it eg if am working on `neverhaveiever` questions i'll use today's date to start the name so it'll look like this `21-Aug-neverhaveiever.json`, thinking of a better file naming structure.
